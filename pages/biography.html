<h1>Biography</h1>
<p>Steve Kim is an animator and illustrator based in northern California. Since a young age he had been inspired by online web animation, as well as the cartoons of his youth. He spent a number of hours starting in middle school dedicated to the craft of bringing illustrations to life. He joined online communities as well as participated in collaborative projects in the time since; honing his drawing skills in parallel.</p>
<p>Steve has a particular fondness of Japanese animators, who in his opinion represent the pinnacle of the craft. Artists such as Yutaka Nakamura, Yoshiyuki Sadamoto and Toshiyuki Inoue he holds in the highest regard and desires continually to train to achieve such skill. Thus, his work focuses on the technical side, with a desire to portray fluid yet realistic movement, paired with solid drawing while maintaining appealing design.</p>
<p>Apart from drawing Steve is also keenly interested in storytelling and all its techniques. One of his favorite hobbies is to watch and analyze film. While the goals day to day are to improve at animation and drawing, his eventual ambition is to tell stories that convey, uplift and inspire just as his favorite films had for himself. To him, films with an “intangible soul” that display the essence of humanity with creativity and finesse are some of man’s greatest creations. Something that stretches out a hand and connects one mind to another; the magic moment where one can empathise is an indescribable transcendent experience.</p>
