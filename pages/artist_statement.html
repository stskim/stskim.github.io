<h1>Artist Statement</h1>
<p>If I were to try and pin down what I think the general motivation for my work would be to convey the human experience. So much of the nature of existence and our place in the world is obscure, and some of the most profound discoveries in mathematics, physics, psychology and philosophy still remain without a clear interpretation. I believe that much of this knowledge continues to be overlooked within, and perhaps due to, entertainment. As such, I would like to create stories and narratives that at the very least open the discussion in a heartful, entertaining way.</p>
<p>The medium I admire most is film, specifically animated film. In my opinion, it embodies the union of different disciplines and mediums (drawing, painting, music, storytelling) and conveys itself in the most poignant form. The films that made the greatest impact on me were those that tackled an existential dilemma regarding human nature, or a story that was exceptionally personal. It is those kinds of films that I recall throughout my life that motivate me to make art, and in similar fashion construct worlds and stories that clarify what it means to be human.</p>
